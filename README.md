Here at the School of Aeronautics at Northwestern Polytechnical University, our research team is dedicated to uncovering the principles of impact dynamics through the power of similitude theory.  Now, you might be wondering, what exactly is similitude theory? In simple terms, it allows us to predict the behavior of complex systems by studying smaller-scale models.  This is especially important in fields like aerospace, where testing full-scale structures under real-world conditions is often impractical or even impossible.
